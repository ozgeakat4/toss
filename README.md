Automated Testing of Systems of Systems
There are various kinds of software applications like mobile
and Web applications. These applications have different types of user
interfaces and user interaction methods. Hence, test automation tools
are either dedicated or configured for a particular kind of application.
Test scenarios can be implemented in the form of scripts and test execution can be automated separately for each type of application. However,
there are systems of systems that embody multiple types of applications
deployed on various platforms. Test scenarios might cross-cut these applications to be controlled collectively in the test script. In this paper,
we propose an approach for testing cross-platform systems of systems.
We present an application of it on a real system that involves a mobile
and a Web application that are supposed to work in coordination. Our
approach integrates a set of existing tools to facilitate test automation.
It provides testers with a unified interface for developing test scripts that
involve both mobile and Web applications. We conduct an industrial case
study and show that our tool can reduce the testing effort significantly.
